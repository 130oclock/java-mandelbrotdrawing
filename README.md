# java-mandelbrotdrawing
A mandelbrot set drawing script in java.

## General info
Created in Eclipse IDE. 
Draws a single image of the Mandelbrot set. Change the x0, x1, y0, y1 values to change the coordinates of the mandelbrot set that are drawn.

## Mandelbrot set
The Mandelbrot set (/ˈmændəlbrɒt/) is the set of complex numbers {\displaystyle c}c for which the function {\displaystyle f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c}{\displaystyle f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c} does not diverge when iterated from {\displaystyle z=0}z=0, i.e., for which the sequence {\displaystyle f_{c}(0)}{\displaystyle f_{c}(0)}, {\displaystyle f_{c}(f_{c}(0))}{\displaystyle f_{c}(f_{c}(0))}, etc., remains bounded in absolute value. Its definition is credited to Adrien Douady who named it in tribute to the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, a pioneer of fractal geometry.[1]
